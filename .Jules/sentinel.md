## 2024-05-24 - [XSS in Dynamic HTML Generation]
**Vulnerability:** DOM-based XSS in the `Toast` component due to direct interpolation of user input into `innerHTML`.
**Learning:** Even internal utility components like `Toast` can be vectors for XSS if they treat input as HTML by default, especially when developers might unknowingly pass unsanitized strings (like filenames).
**Prevention:** Use `textContent` for dynamic content or safer alternatives like `document.createElement` to ensure all user input is treated as text, not HTML. Only use `innerHTML` for trusted, static content.
